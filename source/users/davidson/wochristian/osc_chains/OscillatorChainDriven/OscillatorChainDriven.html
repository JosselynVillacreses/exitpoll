      Traveling
      Waves on an Oscillator Chain
    </h1>
    <p>
      <i>Driven Oscillator Chain </i>models a one-dimensional linear array of coupled simple harmonic oscillators driven at one end and attached to a sliding rod shock absorber at the other. 
      The mass and damping of the shock absorber are chosen to 
      eliminate reflections at the driving frequency.
    </p><p>
      A traveling wave propagates along the oscillator chain in the positive x-direction with a wave function &#934;(x,t) that 
      depends on position and time&nbsp; </p><p align="center">
      &nbsp;<img border="0" src="traveling_wave.gif" width="173" height="30"></p><p>
      where A is the amplitude, &#969;=2&#960;f is the angular frequency, and k=2&#960;/&#955; is the wave number.&nbsp; The 
      angular frequency and wave number are related though the dispersion relationship</p><p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="osc_chain_frequency.gif">.</p><p align="left">
      An interesting and important feature of this dispersion relationship is that it predicts a maximum frequency w<sub>H</sub>=(4K/M)<sup><font 
      size="2">1/2</font></sup>.&nbsp; What type of motion is observed if the diving frequency is greater than this maximum?</p>
