      Oscillator Chain Resonance
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Oscillator Chain Resonance model displays the total mechanical 
      energy as a function of frequency in a chain of coupled 
      oscillators. The chain is driven at one end&nbsp; by a sinusoidal force
      F<sub>drive</sub> =sin(&#969;t) and the total energy is measured after skipping a large number 
      of drive cycles to allow the system to reach steady state. Particles are also subject to&nbsp; a small damping force F<sub>Stokes</sub>= - bv 
      to remove transients and to limit the amplitude of the oscillation.
    </p><p>
      For a simple one-dimensional 
      Hooke's Law model with spring constant k, the kinetic energy of the <i>i</i>-th 
      particle is K<sub>i</sub>= (1/2)Mv<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> and potential 
      energy of each spring is U<sub>i</sub>= (1/2) k&#916;y<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>. 
      The total energy E = U + K for a lattice of N molecules is the sum of 
      these energies.

    Newton's second law.</p>
