    <p>
      A one-dimensional wave function u(x,t) is a function that shows a disturbance at 
      position x and and time t. The disturbance can be mass density, 
      pressure, or electric field depending on the physical context. Although 
      a sinusoidal wave function is a very common type type of disturbance, we 
      should remember that there are many other wave functions, such as shock 
      waves, that do not fit this functional form.</p><p>
      Enter an analytic function u(x,t) and observe its time evolution.&nbsp; How many sample points are needed to accurately 
      represent the shape of the wave function?</p>

      This simulation was created by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy Java 
		Simulations (Ejs) modeling tool.&nbsp;You can modify this 
		simulation if you have Ejs installed by right-clicking within a plot and 
		selecting &quot;Open Ejs Model&quot; from the pop-up menu. Information about
