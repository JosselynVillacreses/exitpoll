      Reflected and Transmitted
      Waves on an Oscillator Chain
    </h1>
    <p>
      <i>Oscillator Chain Reflection </i>models a one-dimensional linear array of coupled simple harmonic oscillators with mass M<sub>1</sub> 
      and mass M<sub>2</sub> on the left and right halves of the chain, respectively.&nbsp; The model is driven at the left end 
      and attached to a sliding rod shock absorber at the right end. 
      The right end mass and damping of the shock absorber are chosen to 
      eliminate reflections at the driving frequency.
    </p><p>
      The driven end produces a wave propagating in the positive x-direction with a wave function</p><p align="center">
      &nbsp;<img border="0" src="traveling_wave.gif" width="173" height="30"></p><p>
      where A is the amplitude, &#969;=2&#960;f is the angular frequency, and k=2&#960;/&#955; is the wave number.&nbsp; A 
      standing wave pattern is formed on the chain's left half because the mass discontinuity at the center produces a reflected 
      wave.&nbsp; A transmitted traveling wave is observed on the right half of the chain and this wave is absorbed at the 
      boundary.</p>
