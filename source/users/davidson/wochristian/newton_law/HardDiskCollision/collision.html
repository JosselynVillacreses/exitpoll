    <p>Conservation laws play a fundamental role in physics and most physicists would argue that they are more fundamental then Newton's 
    Laws.&nbsp; In the Hard Disk Collision model, conservation of energy and momentum are used to compute the trajectories of two 
    balls aced on by a strong but brief collision force.&nbsp; The hard disk (impulse) approximation assumes that the interaction 
    acts instantaneously along a line connecting the particle centers when the the particles come into contact.&nbsp; Because the 
    particles do not interact except for this brief instant, we need only consider kinetic energy when computing 
    the total energy of the system.</p><p align="center">E<sub>total </sub>= (1/2) m<sub>1</sub> v<sub>1</sub><sup>2 </sup>&nbsp;+ 
    (1/2) m<sub>2</sub> v<sub>2</sub><sup>2 </sup></p><p>The total momentum of the system is also easy to compute and is the sum 
    of the momentum of the two particles.</p>
    <p align="center"><b>p</b><sub>total </sub>= m<sub>1</sub> <b>v</b><sub>1</sub><sup> </sup>&nbsp;+ m<sub>2</sub> <b>v</b><sub>2</sub><sup>
    </sup></p>
    <p align="left">The bold typeface indicates that momentum and velocity are vectors so the above equation becomes to two 
    equations when written <i>xy</i> component form.&nbsp; Newtonian mechanics predicts that for an isolated system 
	total momentum is always conserved and total energy is conserved if the particles do not have hidden degrees of 
	freedom such&nbsp; as spin or heat capacity.&nbsp; Collisions that conserve energy are said to be totally elastic because the 
    balls bounce off of each other.</p>
    <p align="left">The analysis of a physics problem can be difficult or easy depending on the frame of reference.&nbsp; Satisfying the conditions of 
	conservation of energy and momentum leads to a system of coupled linear and quadratic equations that is an algebraic mess.&nbsp; However, the collision 
	dynamics becomes trivial if this same collision is viewed from a reference frame that is moving with the center of mass of the 
    particles.&nbsp; The particles meet at the center of mass and reverse direction.&nbsp; 
    Moving to the center of mass reference frame does not changed the physics, only the mathematics that is needed to solve the problem has changed.&nbsp; The 
	center of mass is shown a a cross in the simulation.</p>
	<p align="left"><i>Note:&nbsp;</i> The model shown assumes equal masses.&nbsp; Because this Launcher package is a tutorial, readers are asked to modify 
	the model to include arbitrary values of&nbsp; m<sub>1 </sub>and<sub> </sub>m<sub>2</sub>.</p>
