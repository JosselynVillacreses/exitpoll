    <h1>Collision Modeling Activities</h1><p align="left">Install Ejs and then right-click on a launch node (green 
    arrow) to copy the Free Fall model from this package into the Ejs workspace to do the following activities.</p>
    <h3>Head on collision</h3><p align="left">Set the impact parameter to zero and observe what happens in a head on collision between two equal 
	masses?&nbsp; Explain why the observed motion conserves both energy and momentum in a trivial 
	manner.</p>
    <h3>Vector nature of momentum.</h3><p align="left">Why are the vertical velocity components of the two balls always equal but opposite if the 
	particles have equal mass?&nbsp; What impact parameter 
	that produces a 90 degree angle between the balls after collision?</p>
	<h3>Unequal Mass</h3><p align="left">Extend the model to simulate the collision of two unequal masses of equal size.&nbsp; 
	Predict the result of a head on collision if the stationary mass m<sub>2</sub> is much larger than the incident 
	mass m<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp; Repeat for a stationary mass m<sub>2</sub> that is much smaller than the incident mass m<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp; </p>
	<h3>Inelastic Collision</h3><p align="left">Change the model to simulate the collision of two 
    particles that stick together.&nbsp; Such a collision is said to be totally inelastic because the maximum about of kinetic energy 
    is converted to heat.</p>
