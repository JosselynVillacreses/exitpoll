    <h1>
    Newton's First Law
    </h1>

    <p>
      <i>Lex I: Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi 
      uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur 
      statum illum mutare.</i>&nbsp;
      <i>(Isaac Newton 1687)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1687 Isaac Newton wrote in the Principia Mathematica &quot;An object at 
      rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external and unbalanced 
      force. An object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an 
      external and unbalanced force.&quot;&#160; This law implies that it is possible to 
      select a reference frame, called an inertial reference frame, in which a 
      free particle moves without any change in velocity. The First Law is 
      often simplified as follows: <i>&#160;</i>An object in motion will 
      remain in motion unless acted upon by another force.

      What&#160; is interesting about this Ejs model is that dragging the on-screen 
      ball or the arrow automatically change the model's variables.&#160; Double 
      click on the green arrow in the Launcher table of contents tree to run 
      the First Law model.&#160; You can drag the particle to set its position and 
      you can drag the arrow to set the particle's velocity.</p><p>
      The Ejs implementation of Newton's first law is very simple.&#160; The 
      Evolution workpanel merely advances the position and time.

      <pre>x = x + vx*dt;
y = y + vy*dt;
t = t + dt;</pre>

    <p>Note that the equals sign does not represent mathematical equality when used in Java code.&nbsp; The equals sign is a 
    replacement operation that says:&nbsp; &quot;Replace the value on the left hand side with the value of the expression on the right 
    hand side.&quot; </p>
