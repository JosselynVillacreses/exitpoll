	<p align="left">The <i>First Law</i> model was built with the <i>Easy Java 
	Simulations</i> (<i>Ejs</i>) modeling tool.&nbsp; Ejs is a Java program that 
	enables both programmers and novices to quickly and easily prototype, test, 
	and distribute packages of Java simulations. It can be downloaded from the 
	Ejs website and installed (unzipped) into a directory of your choice.&nbsp;

	<p align="left">An important feature of the programs in the jar file is that 
	it was created in such a way that users can return to the Ejs authoring tool 
	at any time to examine, modify, and adapt the Ejs models.&nbsp; Right-click 
	within the simulation and select Open Ejs Model to invoke this feature.&nbsp; 
	(You must, of course, have already downloaded and installed Ejs.)&nbsp; The 
	Ejs authoring tool will appear.</p>
