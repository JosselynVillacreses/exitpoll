      The average speed distribution for a 30 particle hard disk gas.</p><p><b>Hard Disk Gas</b> models a two-dimensional gas by extending 
    the collision model to multiple particles.&nbsp; Particles are initialized with a speed v=1 in a random direction and move with constant velocity until a collision 
	event is detected.&nbsp; Conservation of momentum and energy are applied and the simulation is resumed until the next 
    collision event is detected.&nbsp; Although collision detection is not the most efficient computation algorithm for this problem, it is straightforward, accurate and 
	fast-enough for small numbers of particles to show the physics that gives rise to a simple model of an inert monatomic gas.<br>&nbsp;</p>
