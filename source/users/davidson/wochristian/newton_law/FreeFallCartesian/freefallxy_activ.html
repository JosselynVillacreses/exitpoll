    <h1 align="left">Free Fall XY Modeling Activities</h1><p align="left">Install Ejs and then right-click on a launch node (green 
    arrow) to copy the Free Fall model from this package into the Ejs workspace to do the following activities.</p><h3 align="left">Vector Nature of Force</h3><p align="left">Set the 
    coefficient of restitution equal to zero. What is the maximum horizontal velocity component v<sub>x</sub> that will give exactly 
    two bounces on the table top?&nbsp; What is the maximum horizontal velocity if the coefficient of restitution is 0.4?</p>
    <h3 align="left">Friction</h3><p align="left">The model assumes that energy is lost only during the floor collision.&nbsp; 
    Modify the differential equation to include energy loss due to air friction.&nbsp; This energy loss can be modeled by 
    including a friction (fluid drag) force <b>F</b><sub>friction</sub> that is proportional to the velocity:</p><p align="center"><b>F</b><sub>friction </sub>= - b 
    <b>v .</b></p>
    <p align="left">Because drag is a vector force it will affect the ball's motion in both the x and y directions.&nbsp; Compare 
	the effect of friction in 
    this activity with the one-dimensional Free Fall activity.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Spin (Advanced)</h3><p align="left">A realistic spinning ball model includes the Magnus force which 
	is 
    perpendicular to the axis of rotation.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><b>F</b><sub>Magnus </sub>=&nbsp; C<sub>m </sub><b>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&#969;</font></b> <font size="2">x</font> <b>v .</b></p>
    <p align="left">C<sub>m</sub> is a drag coefficient that depends on the object and <b><font face="Times New Roman">&#969;</font></b>
    <font size="2">x</font> <b>v </b>is the vector cross product between the ball's angular velocity and the ball's linear 
    velocity.&nbsp; Extend the 2D model to 3D and add this force. (The Ejs manual describes 3D models.)</p>
