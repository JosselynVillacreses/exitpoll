    <p align="left"><i>Free Fall Cartesian</i> extends the Free Fall model of a ball bouncing on a table top to include motion in the x 
    (horizontal) direction.&nbsp; The model includes a trace that shows the ball's trajectory as well as a more sophisticated 
    collision algorithm that takes into account the finite width of the table top.&nbsp; 
    Newton's second law <b>F</b> = m<b>a</b>&nbsp; is a vector equation and&nbsp; it must be satisfied in both the horizontal and vertical direction.</p>
    <p align="center">F<sub>x</sub> = ma<sub>x</sub><br>
    F<sub>y</sub> = ma<sub>y</sub> .</p><p align="left">Because the force in the x (horizontal) direction is zero, the associated 
    acceleration a<sub>x</sub> is also zero and the velocity v<sub>x</sub> is constant.&nbsp; As in the Free Fall model, an 
	impulsive normal 
    force acting perpendicular to the table top reverses the ball's velocity upon collision.&nbsp; The table top corner is treated 
    as a special case.&nbsp; The impulsive force from a corner collision is applied along a line from the corner toward the ball 
    center.</p>
