    <p><i>Free Fall</i> models a ball that is dropped near the surface of Earth.&nbsp; Newton's second law states that a force <i><b>F</b></i> produces an acceleration <i><b>a</b></i> that is 
    proportional to the mass <i>m</i> of the falling object.</p><p align="center"><b>F </b>= m<b>a .</b></p><p align="left">
    A freely falling object is acted on by a constant downward gravitational force if we ignore air resistance. Because 
    this gravitational force <b>F</b><sub> </sub>is constant and because it is proportional to the mass of the falling object, all objects near 
    Earth fall with the same constant downward acceleration <i><b>g</b></i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; In the Free Fall 
    model, the ball's speed is reduced by a constant factor at every 
    floor collision.&nbsp;&nbsp; All motion takes place in the vertical (y) direction to keep this first Ejs example as simple as 
    possible.</p>
