    <p>The Free Fall model uses 6 variables having their usual meaning.&nbsp; The variable g is the acceleration new Earth's surface 
    due to gravity in m/s<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; The coefficient of restitution is 
    used to reduce the speed of the falling object at each bounce. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Numerical algorithms for solving second order differential equations, such as Newton's 
    Second Law, usually require that the differential equation be rewritten as a system of first ordinary differential equations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    This is a straightforward process if we introduce a variable for each velocity component.&nbsp; Because the ball's motion 
    occurs only along the y (vertical) axis, we introduce the variable v<sub>y</sub>.&nbsp; For the simple Free Fall 
    example the differential equations for vertical position y and velocity v<sub>y</sub> can be written as:</span></p>
    <h4 align="center"><span style="font-weight: 400">dy/dt = v<sub>y</sub><br>
    dv<sub>y</sub>/dt =-9.8 .</span></h4>
    <p align="left">Differential equations for position y and the velocity v<sub>y</sub><b> </b>are entered on the Ejs 
	Evolution page.</p>
    <h4 align="center"><img border="0" src="freefall_ode.gif"></h4>
    <p align="left">Modeling the bounce requires an Ejs event that is triggered when the ball passes through the table top.&nbsp;An 
    Ejs event occurs when the event's zero condition becomes negative.&nbsp; Because the table is located at y=0, we can use the 
    y-position of the ball to trigger the event.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="freefallaction.jpg"></p>
    <p align="left">If the ball is below the floor and if the velocity is downward, the zero condition is negative and the event's action 
    takes place.&nbsp; Note that Ejs automatically determines the time of the event (to within the given tolerance) before applying the 
    action. The time evolution will then continue unless the <i>Stop at event</i> box is selected.&nbsp; In the Simple Free Fall model, the 
    event's action diminishes the speed of 
    the ball and causes the ball to move upward.</p>
