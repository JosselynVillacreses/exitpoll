    <h1 align="left">Free Fall Modeling Activities</h1><p align="left">Install Ejs and then right-click on a launch node (green 
    arrow) to copy the Free Fall model from this jar file into the Ejs workspace to do the following activities.</p>
    <h2 align="left">Friction</h2><p align="left">The Free Fall model assumes that energy is lost only during the floor collision.&nbsp; 
    Set the coefficient of restitution&nbsp; to 1.0 in the model and modify the differential equation to include energy loss due to friction 
	(fluid drag).&nbsp; This energy loss can be modeled by 
    including a friction force F<sub>friction</sub> that is proportional to the velocity:</p><p align="center">F<sub>friction</sub>= - b <b>v .</b></p>
    <p align="left">The drag coefficient <i>b</i> depends on the shape of the object and should be included in the model 
	as an additional variable.&nbsp; A good value for simulation is b/m =0.1 although realistic values for objects in 
	air is lower.&nbsp; What is the significance of the negative sign in the friction 
    formula?</p><h2 align="left">Energy</h2><p align="left">Add a plot of total 
    energy E(t) to the simple free fall model.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the energy plot similar to a plot of radioactive decay?&nbsp; 
    Plots are described in the Ejs manual but note that the Pendulum model in this package includes a plot and can be used as a 
    template for this activity.</p>
