      A hard sphere model of an ideal gas.</p><p><b>Hard Sphere Gas</b> extends the Hard Disk model to three dimensions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Particles move with constant velocity until a collision event is detected.&nbsp; Although collision detection is not the most 
    efficient computation algorithm for this problem, it is straightforward, accurate and fast-enough for small numbers of 
    particles to show the physics that gives rise to a simple model of an inert monatomic gas.&nbsp; The accumulate data averages 
    the speed histogram over many time steps.</p>
