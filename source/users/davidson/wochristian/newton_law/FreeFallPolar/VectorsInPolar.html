      &nbsp;Vectors in Polar Coordinates
    </h1>

    <p>
      The Free Fall in Polar Coordinates model computes the trajectory of a freely falling particle using Newton's second law 
      expressed in polar coordinates.&nbsp; The model shows a ball, its trajectory, and arrows representing the instantaneous 
      radial and tangential components of the ball's velocity. The ball bounces elastically off of an immovable beam extending to 
      the right of the origin.</p><p>
      Newton's second law <b>F</b>=m<b>a</b> is a vector equation and is 
      independent of the type of the coordinate system used to express the problem.&nbsp; In polar coordinates, any vector <b>A</b> 
      can be expressed as a sum of vector components (A<sub>r</sub>, A<sub><font face="Symbol">q</font></sub>) in the radial and 
      tangential directions using unit vectors <b>e</b><sub>r</sub> and <b>e</b><sub><font face="Symbol">q</font></sub>, 
      respectively.</p><p align="center">

      Note that vectors are often written in bold face font to distinguish them from scalars.</p><p>
      The position of a particle r can be expressed as the product of a distance r and a unit radial vector <b>e</b><sub>r</sub> 
      but the velocity and acceleration are more complicated because r and <b>e</b><sub>r</sub> vary as the particle moves.&nbsp; 
      The following relations are easily derived and can be found in most mechanics and mathematical methods books.</p>

      These kinematic expressions describe the motion of a particle without consideration of the forces that bring about the 
      motion.&nbsp; In order to study the meaning of these equations, we solve Newton's second law for a particle subject to a 
      constant force in the next section.
