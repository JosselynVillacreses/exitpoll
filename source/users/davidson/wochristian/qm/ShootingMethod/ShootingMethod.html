      Energy Eigenfunctions and the Shooting Method
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Shooting Method&nbsp; model solves the time independent Schrödinger equation with potential energy V(x) when the energy 
      E is changed.</p><p align="center">

      Not all solutions this differential equation are valid.&nbsp; We seek solutions <font face="Symbol">y</font>(x) that are 
      zero outside of a finite spatial region [x<sub>min</sub>, x<sub>max</sub>] and we require that the solution be zero at the 
      boundaries in order to avoid a discontinuous jump in <font face="Symbol">y</font>(x).&nbsp; A solution to the time 
      independent Schrödinger equation that satisfies these conditions is known as an energy eigenfunction.
    </p><p>
      Adjust the energy E to find the energy eigenfunctions for various potential energies. The differential equation is solved 
      starting at the left boundary when the slider is moved. (Plank's constant h and mass m are one.)&nbsp; The error in
      <font face="Symbol">y</font>(x) at the right boundary is shown as a red 
      line. The computation is automatically terminated if the solution becomes 
      larger than 10<sup>9 </sup>because a valid eigenfunction must be finite 
      and normalizable.</p>
