      Free Particle Wave Packet
    </h1>
    <p>
      A localized wave function is referred to as a wave packet. The most 
      common wave packet has a Gaussian envelope (shape). The Schr&#246;dinger 
      equation determines the time evolution of this wave packet. Although the 
      square of the area of the wave packet (total probability) remains 
      constant, the wave packet spreads in position space as shown in this model of the analytic solution.&nbsp; Why doesn't the wave packet change in momentum 
		space?</p>
