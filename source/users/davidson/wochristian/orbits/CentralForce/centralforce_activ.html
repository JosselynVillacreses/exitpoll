    <h1 align="left">Central Force Activities</h1><p align="left">Install Ejs and then right-click on a launch node (green arrow) 
    to copy the Free Fall model from this package into the Ejs workspace to do the following activities.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Circular motion</h3><p align="left">Objects in uniform circular motion accelerate toward the center with an 
    acceleration of magnitude |a| = v<sup>2</sup>/r where v is the speed of the object.&nbsp; Assume that this centripetal 
    acceleration is produce by an inverse square law central force.&nbsp; Compute the velocity needed to produce circular motion 
    with r =2, 4, and 8.&nbsp; Test your answers by entering them into the Central Force program's input fields.&nbsp; Verify that 
    the Central Force model satisfies Kepler's third law.</p><h3 align="left">Angular Momentum and Energy</h3><p align="left">Add a custom 
    method to the model to compute the total energy and test various ODE solvers to see how well energy is conserved.&nbsp; 
    Perform your test for both circular and eccentric (elliptical) orbits.&nbsp; Repeat for total angular momentum.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Polar Coordinates (Advanced)</h3><p align="left">Model the inverse square law using polar coordinates 
    by deriving (or looking up) the differential equations for r and <font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font> and using these 
    equations to evolve the system.&nbsp; As was done in the Pendulum model, you must convert&nbsp; r and <font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font>&nbsp; 
    polar coordinates to x and y Cartesian coordinates to set the position of the orbiting particle.</p>
