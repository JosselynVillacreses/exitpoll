    <p>Newton's universal law of gravitation states that two spherical particles of mass M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub> attracted 
    each other with a force F<sub>12</sub> that is inversely proportional to their separation 
    squared and is directed along a line connecting their centers</p><p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="gravitation_eqn.gif"></p>
    <p>The direction of the force on M<sub>1</sub> is indicated by a unit vector &quot;r-hat&quot; pointing from M<sub>1 </sub>to M<sub>2</sub>. 
    The proportionality constant G depends on the system of units and takes 
    the value G = 6.67x10<sup>-11</sup> 
    m<sup>3</sup>/kg<sup>.</sup>s in the metric system.</p><p>
    Because two gravitationally interacting particles orbit in a plane about their common center of mass, we choose a polar coordinate system with the center of 
	mass fixed at the origin.&nbsp; In many orbit problems one mass (the Sun) is much larger than the orbiting mass and is 
	approximately stationary at the origin. This reduces the two-body problem to that of a one-body problem moving under the influence of a gravitational 
    inverse square law force.&nbsp; Intermediate mechanics texts 
	show that all two-body orbits problems can be reduced to an equivalent one-body problem so this inverse square law model is very general.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
    Applying Newton's Second Law <b>F</b> = M<sub>1</sub><b>a</b> to the orbiting mass and using units such that M<sub>2</sub>G=1 the acceleration 
    of the orbiting mass becomes</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="acceleration_eqn.gif">.</p><p>Rewriting this vector formula using Cartesian 
    components and recognizing that sin(<font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font>) = y/r, cos(<font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font>) = 
    x/r, and 
	r = (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> in the plane of the orbit gives the following coupled differential equations for input into the Ejs model.</p>
