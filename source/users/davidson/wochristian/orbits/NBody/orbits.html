      An unusual 7-body orbit for gravitationally interacting particles.</p><p><b>N-Body </b>solves the gravitation n-body problem 
    for gravitationally interacting particles.&nbsp; 
    The solution of this problem has inspired and challenged physicists and mathematicians for centuries and few solutions for N&gt;2 
    are known.&nbsp; The three-body orbit shown in this model was discovered by Moore in 1993 and proved to be stable 
	by Chenciner and Montgomery in 2000. Other unusual N-body orbits have since been found although all orbits with N&gt; 3 are 
    unstable (and chaotic) and sooner or later the trajectories will fly diverge and the choreography will break. </p><p>The 
    initial-condition data for N&gt;4 has been kindly provided by Carles Simó, UAB, Spain.<br></p>
