<h1>Demon Monte Carlo Models </h1>
<p>The <i>Lennard-Jones Demon</i> model uses the demon Monte 
Carlo algorithm to simulate <i>n</i> particles interacting through the Lennard-Jones 
potential. A Monte Carlo method is a stochastic (nondeterministic) algorithm that 
uses random numbers to sample the microcannonical ensemble. The microcanonical ensemble 
is a large number number of systems with the same energy each of which represents 
a possible state of the actual system. </p>

<p>A Monte Carlo demon is an extra degree of freedom that 
is allowed to transfer energy as it attempts to change the state of the system. 
The demon keeps track of its own energy and can take or give energy to a particle 
as it interacts with a randomly chosen particle. Because the demon cannot have negative 
energy, the total energy of the system remains constant -- as it should in the microcanonical 
ensemble. The demon is, in effect, a thermometer. Its extra degree of freedom perturbs 
the system very little and the average demon energy is proportional to the temperature 
of the system. (See Statistical and Thermal Physics notes by H. Gould and J. Tobochnik.)
</p>

<p>Simple Monte Carlo methods become inefficient (or fail) 
if they do not sample all possible configurations (phase space). The Lennard-Jones 
Demon model shows snapshots of phase space sampled by the demon algorithm. Do the 
snapshots in this simulation suggest that demon is able to sample all of phase space 
at high temperature? Low temperature? </p>
