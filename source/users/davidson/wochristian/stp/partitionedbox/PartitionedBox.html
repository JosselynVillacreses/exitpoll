      Approach to Equilibrium
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Box Equilibrium model simulates a box that is divided into two parts 
		of equal volume. The left half initially contains a gas of N identical 
		particles and the right half is empty. We then make a small hole in the 
		partition between the two halves. What happens? We expect that after 
		some time, the system reaches equilibrium, and the average number of 
		particles in each half of the box is N/2. The purpose of this simulation 
		is to gain insight into the tendency of macroscopic systems to approach 
		a well defined equilibrium macrostate and the importance of fluctuations 
		in equilibrium.

      This simulation was created by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy Java

		simulation if you have Ejs installed by right-clicking within a plot and 
		selecting &quot;Open Ejs Model&quot; from the pop-up menu. Information about Ejs
