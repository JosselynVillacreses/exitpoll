<h1>Galton Board</h1>

<p>A Galton board is a vertical board with <i>n</i> rows of pegs onto which a ball is dropped.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time a ball hits a peg, 
it has a probability <i>p</i> of bouncing to the left and a probability of&nbsp; 1<i>-p</i> of bouncing to the right.&nbsp; The 
simulation's histogram shows the distribution of x-coordinates as the balls leave the board and are collected into bins.</p><p>The simulation 
gives rise to the binomial distribution if the probabilities of left and right bounces are equal. At first there does not seem to be 
any pattern but after many trials the familiar &quot;bell curve&quot; shape begins to emerge.</p>
