<h1>Metropolis Monte Carlo Models </h1>
<p>The <i>Lennard-Jones Metropolis</i> model uses the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm 
to simulate <i>n</i> particles interacting through the Lennard-Jones potential. 
A Monte Carlo method is a stochastic (nondeterministic) algorithm that uses random 
numbers to sample an ensemble. The canonical ensemble is a large number number of 
systems with the same temperature each of which represents a possible state of the 
actual system. Although the temperature of the cannonical ensemble is constant, 
the energy of a system in the ensemble is not. </p>
<p>Simple Monte Carlo methods become inefficient (or fail) if they do not sample 
all possible configurations (phase space). The Lennard-Jones Metropolis model shows 
snapshots of phase space sampled by the Metropolis algorithm. Do the snapshots 
in this simulation suggest that phase space is being sampled correctly at high temperature? 
Low temperature? </p>

<p>This simulation was created by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy Java Simulations 
(Ejs) modeling tool.&nbsp; You can modify this simulation if you have Ejs installed 
by right-clicking within a plot and selecting &quot;Open Ejs Model&quot; from the pop-up menu.
