<h1>Two-Dimensional Ising Model</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A Monte Carlo simulation of the two-dimensional Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. The instantaneous energy and 
magnetization are plotted as a function of time. The Metropolis algorithm is used.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Choose the linear dimension L = 32 and the heat bath temperature T = 2. How would you qualitatively describe the spin configurations? Are there large correlated regions where the spins are parallel? Increase T to T = 4 and describe your observations.</li>
</ul>
