<h1>Approach to Equilibrium: Molecular Dynamics </h1>
<p>The program implements a molecular dynamics simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid 
in two dimensions. The particles are initialized in the middle third of the simulation 
cell. The number of particles in each of the three cells is plotted. </p>

<h2>Algorithm </h2>
<p>The algorithm for simulating the evolution of the model can be summarized by 
the following steps: </p>
<ol>
	<li>The particles are placed at random in the center of the box with the constraint 
	that no two particles can be closer than the length σ = 1 in the Lennard-Jones 
	potential. This constraint prevents the initial force between any two particles 
	from being too big, which would lead to the breakdown of the numerical method 
	used to solve the differential equations. The velocity of each particle is assigned 
	at random and then the velocity of the center of mass is set to zero. </li>
	<li>The total force on each particle is computed and the positions and velocities 
	are updated according to the Verlet algorithm. </li>
	<li>The time is increased by the time step Δt. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Note: </h3>
<p>This simulation was created by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy Java Simulations 
(Ejs) modeling tool.&nbsp; It is based on a Java program from the Statistical and 
Thermal Physics Project. You can modify this simulation if you have Ejs installed 
by right-clicking within a plot and selecting &quot;Open Ejs Model&quot; from the pop-up menu 
item. Information about Ejs is available at: &lt;<b>http://www.um.es/fem/Ejs/</b>&gt;.</p>
