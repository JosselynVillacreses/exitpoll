    <h1>Driven Harmonic Oscillator Activities</h1><p>Install Ejs and then right-click on a launch node 
    (green arrow) to copy the Free Fall model from this package into the Ejs workspace to do the following activities.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Homogeneous and Inhomogeneous Solutions</h3><p align="left">Set the initial displacement to A<sub>0</sub>
    <font face="Times New Roman">&#8800; 0 </font>and the velocity and drive amplitude F<sub>D</sub> to zero in order to observe the 
    homogeneous solutions.&nbsp; Estimate the decay time <font face="Times New Roman">&#964;</font> for an oscillatory homogeneous 
    solution.&nbsp; Set the drive amplitude and&nbsp; F<sub>D</sub> <font face="Times New Roman">&#8800; 0 </font>
	and observe the steady state behavior when time is greater than the decay time<font face="Times New Roman"> 
	t &gt;&gt; &#964;.</font></p><h3 align="left">
	Resonance</h3><p align="left">Measure the steady state amplitude when the drive frequency is equal to the 
    natural frequency of oscillation. Shift the drive frequency away from resonance and note the steady state amplitude decreases.&nbsp; 
    The driving frequency that produces the maximum steady state amplitude is know as the resonant frequency. </p><p align="left">
    What is the driving frequency that is required to decreases the steady state amplitude by 50% from its resonant value.&nbsp; 
    Is the frequency shift for this condition the same above and below resonance?</p><p align="left">
    Set the damping constant to zero and describe the steady state behavior at resonance, above resonance, and below resonance.&nbsp; 
    Does a steady state even exist?</p><h3 align="left">
    Phase Shift</h3><p align="left">Add a graph of F<sub><i>external</i></sub>&nbsp; 
    to the displacement plot.&nbsp; What is the phase shift between the driving frequency and the steady state displacement at 
    resonance?&nbsp; Above resonance when the amplitude is 50% of its resonant value?&nbsp; Below resonance when the amplitude is 
    50% of its resonant value?</p>
    <h3 align="left">
	Nonsinusoidal Driving Force (Intermediate)</h3>
    <p align="left">
	Modify the model so that the external driving force is a &quot;square wave&quot; that periodically switches between +A<sub>0</sub> and - 
    A<sub>0</sub>.&nbsp; Explain the shape of the displacement x(t) plot.</p>
    <p align="left">
	Hint: Use a square wave period approximately 10 times longer the natural frequency of oscillation for interesting results.</p>
	<h3 align="left">
	Driven Pendulum (Advanced)</h3>
	<p align="left">Extend the Driven Harmonic Oscillator model so that it models a driven pendulum.&nbsp; (Or extend 
	the Pendulum model to add friction and a sinusoidal driving torque.)&nbsp; Is there a resonance at the natural 
	oscillatory frequency 
	of the pendulum?&nbsp; If so, how is this resonance different from the resonance observed for the 
	mass-spring system?</p>
