    <p>Consider a mass <i>m</i> situated at the end of a spring of length <i>L</i> with negligible mass.&nbsp; Hooke's Law states 
    states that the reaction of the spring is proportional to its displacement <i>x</i> from the equilibrium point , F<i><sub>spring</sub> 
    =</i> -k x<i> </i>, where <i>k</i> is a constant which depends on the physical characteristics of the spring.
    <span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span>Applying Newton's Second Law leads to the following second order differential equation </p>
    <p align="center">d<sup>2</sup>x / dt<sup>2</sup> = -(k/m) x .</p>
    <p>This equation occurs frequently through the sciences and produces simple harmonic motion.&nbsp; Because the solution 
    depends only on the ratio <i>k/m</i>&nbsp; and because this ratio is always a positive number, the differential equation is 
    usually recast in terms of an angular frequency parameter&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">&#969;</font> = (k/m)<sup>1/2</sup> 
    .</p>
    <p align="center">d<sup>2</sup>x / dt<sup>2</sup> = - <font face="Times New Roman">&#969;</font><sup>2</sup> x </p>
    <p>The analytic solution to this differential equation is well know and can be expressed in terms of a sinusoidal 
    function</p>
    <p align="center">x(t) = A sin( <font face="Times New Roman">&#969;</font>t + <font face="Times New Roman">&#966; </font>) </p>
    <p>where the amplitude A is the maximum displacement and the phase angle <font face="Times New Roman">&#966;</font> is 
    determines that location of&nbsp; mass at time t=0.&nbsp; The angular frequency is measured in radians per second and related 
    to the frequency of oscillation by <font face="Times New Roman">&#969;</font>= 2 <font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font> f.</p>
