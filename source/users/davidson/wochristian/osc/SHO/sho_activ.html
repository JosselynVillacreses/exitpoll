<h1>Harmonic Oscillator Activities</h1>
<p>Install Ejs and then right-click on a launch node (green arrow) to copy the Free Fall model from 
this package into the Ejs workspace to do the following activities.</p>
<h3>Period</h3>
<p>Measure the period of the motion for the given initial conditions. Drag with the mouse the ball 
to a new position and measure the period again. How does the period of the oscillation depend on the initial displacement?</p>
<p>Double the mass.&nbsp; By what factor does the period change?&nbsp; Quadruple the mass and repeat.</p>
<h3>Friction</h3>
<p>The model assumes that energy is conserved.&nbsp; Modify the differential equation to include 
energy loss due to air friction.&nbsp; This energy loss can be modeled by including a friction (drag) force F<sub>friction</sub><b>
</b>that is proportional to the velocity:</p>
<p align="center">F<sub>friction</sub>= - b v<b> .</b></p>
<p>The drag coefficient <i>b</i> depends on the shape of the object and should be included in the 
model as an additional variable.&nbsp; A good value for simulation is b/m =0.1 although realistic values for objects 
in air is lower. </p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>Add a plot showing the kinetic energy, potential energy, and total energy to the model.</p>
