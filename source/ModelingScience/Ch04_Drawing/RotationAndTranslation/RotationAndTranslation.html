      Rigid Body Motion in 2D</h1>
    <p>
      The <font SIZE="3">rotation and translation simulation shows a disk with an attached rocket engine. You can drag the engine 
      to change its distance from the center of the disk and you can adjust the thrust of the rocket engine set using a slider.&nbsp; 
      The mass of the rocket and its connecting rod are assumed to be negligible.&nbsp;
  
    </font></p>
    <p>
      <font SIZE="3">Before you run the simulation, predict the trajectory of the disk.&nbsp; Can you give a reason for the 
      observed motion?</font></p>
    <h1>
      Decoupling Rotation and Translation</h1>
    <p>
          The general motion of a rigid body can be decoupled into translational and rotational motion problems that can be solved 
          independently.&nbsp; If the body is free to translate and rotate, the translation is described by the position of its 
          center of mass (<font size="2">X<sub>cm</sub>, Y</font><sub><font size="2">cm</font></sub>) and the rotation is 
          described by an angular displacement <font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font> about the center of mass.&nbsp; The three 
          dynamical coordinates (<font size="2">X<sub>cm</sub>, Y</font><sub><font size="2">cm</font></sub><font 
          face="Times New Roman">, &#952; )</font> each obey their own second order differential equations.</p><p>
          [Give equations here and the describe torque and Newton's second law for rotation.]</p><font SIZE="3"><p>
          EJS makes it straightforward to simulate the rocket-disk motion.&nbsp; The rigid body is modeled as a collection of 
          elements and the group's position (<font size="2">X<sub>cm</sub>, Y</font><sub><font size="2">cm</font></sub>) and 
          orientation <font face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font> are computed by solving the dynamical equations of motion.&nbsp; The 
          only mathematical difficulty is the computation of the x and y component of the rocket thrust. Because the rocket thrust 
          is always directed along the x-direction in the rigid body group, we merely transform the thrust vector (force vector) 
          from the body group to the space (inertial) reference frame to solve for the center of mass motion.&nbsp; Transforming 
          between the space and body frames is a convenient trick in 2D but will become an essential mathematical tool in 3D.</p>
    <p>
          Note:&nbsp; If the rotation axis is fixed about an axis of rotation, rotation must occur about that axis and only the 
          differential equation for the angular displacement <font face="Times New Roman">&#952; </font>must be solved.</p>

      The rotation and translation simulation was created by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy Java Simulations (EJS) modeling tool.&nbsp; You can examine and modify the physical 
		model for this simulation if you have Ejs installed by right-clicking within the wave function plot and selecting &quot;Open Ejs Model&quot; from the pop-up menu.&nbsp;
