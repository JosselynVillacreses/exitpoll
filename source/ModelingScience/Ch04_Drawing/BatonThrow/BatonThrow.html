      Baton Throw and 2D Center of Mass</h1><p>
      The baton throw<font SIZE="3"> simulation shows the motion of two unequal masses joined by a massless rod.&nbsp; 
      Trajectories of the center of mass and of one of the masses are displayed.&nbsp; The baton is thrown with a fixed initial 
      velocity and an angular velocity about the center of mass that can be set.&nbsp; The ratio of the masses can also be set 
      using a slider.</font></p>
    <p>
          The 2D baton throw is a very simple model because the translational (<font size="2">X<sub>cm</sub>, Y</font><sub><font size="2">cm</font></sub><font 
          face="Times New Roman">) </font> and rotational <font 
          face="Times New Roman">&#952;</font>&nbsp; dynamical variables are independent.&nbsp; The center of mass behaves like a point 
          particle acted on by a constant gravitation force in the downward direction.&nbsp; The horizontal motion is uniform and 
          the vertical motion is described by the kinematics of constant acceleration.&nbsp; As the translational motion evolves, 
          the baton spins about its center of mass with constant angular velocity <font face="Verdana">&#969;</font>. </p><p>
          [Give CM formulas here.]</p><font SIZE="3"><p>
          EJS makes it straightforward to simulate combined rotational and translational motion.&nbsp; The baton (rigid body) is 
          modeled as a collection of elements within an EJS group.&nbsp; The 
          only mathematical difficulty is the computation of the red ball's trajectory as seen by a stationary observer.&nbsp; 
          This computation is easy because EJS elements have an internal coordinate system known as the Element's body frame.&nbsp; 
          The center of the red ball is at location (0,0) in its own internal body frame and we can transform this coordinates 
          into the external space frame using in the Evolution workpanel as follows:</p><p>
          ballPos=_view.redBall.toSpaceFrame(new double[]{0,0});</p><p>
          Transforming 
          between the space and body frames is a convenient trick in 2D but will become an essential mathematical tool in 3D.</p>

      The baton throw simulation was created by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy Java Simulations (EJS) modeling tool.&nbsp; You can examine and modify the physical 
		model for this simulation if you have Ejs installed by right-clicking within the wave function plot and selecting &quot;Open Ejs Model&quot; from the pop-up menu.&nbsp;
